This design allows for easy swapping of database implementations (e.g., for testing or changing ORMs).\n4. It facilitates mocking in unit tests, improving testability.\n\nFor example, in api/message.go, the MessageAPI struct uses this interface:\n\ntype MessageAPI struct {\n    DB MessageDatabase\n    // ...\n}\n\nThis design enables dependency injection and flexible database handling throughout the application.","file":"api/message.go","highlight":[{"start":18,"end":28}],"title":"","id":"578"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["database/message.go"],"description":"Let's look at the database/message.go file to see how the MessageDatabase interface is implemented using GORM.","title":"","id":"579"},{"type":"highlight","description":"This method demonstrates efficient querying using GORM.

Error handling treats 'record not found' as a non-error, simplifying API responses.\n\nThis implementation supports efficient pagination in APIs, allowing frontends to request data in manageable chunks.
