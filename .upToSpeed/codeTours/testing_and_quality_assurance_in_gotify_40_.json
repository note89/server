{"title":"Testing and Quality Assurance in Gotify","id":"UUEH0nIPfTYXLOnGoMwyl7OBhizzOHKd3FaELur07Lc=","steps":[{"type":"textOnly","description":"Welcome to our deep dive into Gotify's testing and quality assurance practices. As a senior Go engineer, you'll appreciate how these practices ensure reliability and maintainability in backend systems. We'll explore:\n\n1. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests\n2. Continuous Integration (CI) tools and workflows\n3. Code coverage and static analysis techniques\n4. API testing and documentation practices\n\nThis tour will enhance your ability to design robust APIs that seamlessly integrate with frontend systems. We'll examine actual code, CI configurations, and test files, providing insights into Gotify's comprehensive QA approach. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to contribute to and improve the project's testing ecosystem.","title":"","id":"653"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Let's start by looking at the Makefile, which defines the main test and check commands used in the project.","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":12,"end":14}],"title":"","id":"654"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Gotify leverages Go's built-in testing tools with two crucial features: race detection and coverage reporting. Race detection helps identify concurrent access issues, critical for maintaining thread-safe code in Go's concurrent environment. The coverage reporting generates a profile used by CI tools to ensure comprehensive test coverage. This command runs tests with both features enabled:","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":20,"end":21}],"title":"","id":"655"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Frontend tests are run using Jest. Note how the Gotify executable is built before running the tests, allowing for end-to-end testing of the UI.","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":26,"end":29}],"title":"","id":"656"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Gotify employs golangci-lint, a powerful static analysis tool for Go code. As a senior Go engineer, you'll appreciate how it enhances code quality by:\n\n1. Detecting bugs, performance issues, and style violations\n2. Enforcing consistent code formatting\n3. Running multiple linters concurrently for efficiency\n\nThis tool is crucial for maintaining a high-quality codebase in large projects. The Makefile command below integrates golangci-lint into the project's CI/CD pipeline, ensuring all code meets the defined standards before merging.\n\nExplore the '.golangci.yml' file in the project root to see the specific linters and rules configured for Gotify.","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":31,"end":32}],"title":"","id":"657"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Similar to Go, the JavaScript code also undergoes linting and formatting checks using tools like ESLint and Prettier.","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":34,"end":36}],"title":"","id":"658"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The project uses Swagger to maintain up-to-date API documentation. This check ensures the Swagger spec stays in sync with the codebase, a crucial quality assurance practice.\n\nAs a senior engineer, you'll appreciate how this automated check prevents discrepancies between the API implementation and its documentation. It's particularly valuable when designing APIs for frontend consumption.\n\nThe make target 'check-swagger' updates the spec and verifies if any changes occurred. If the spec is out of sync, the CI pipeline fails, enforcing documentation accuracy.","file":"Makefile","highlight":[{"start":45,"end":51}],"title":"","id":"659"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["api/message_test.go"],"description":"Let's examine how Gotify uses the testify suite for organizing tests. The testify suite provides a structured way to write and run tests, making it easier to manage complex test scenarios.","title":"","id":"664"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Now, let's look at some specific test cases for the message API. These tests demonstrate comprehensive coverage of API functionality.","file":"api/message_test.go","highlight":[{"start":32,"end":61}],"title":"","id":"665"},{"type":"highlight","description":"This file demonstrates end-to-end (E2E) tests for the plugin functionality in the UI. E2E tests are crucial as they validate the entire application stack, ensuring that all components work together as expected.\n\nThe tests use Puppeteer, a powerful browser automation library, to simulate user interactions and verify the UI's behavior. As a backend developer, you'll appreciate how E2E tests complement your API tests by validating the frontend's integration with the backend.\n\nNote how the test setup includes browser initialization and authentication, mirroring real-world usage. This approach helps catch issues that might only appear when all system components interact, which is vital for maintaining overall application quality and user experience.","file":"ui/src/tests/plugin.test.ts","highlight":[{"start":1,"end":30}],"title":"","id":"661"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, a crucial part of maintaining code quality. This workflow file defines the steps for building, testing, and checking the application on every push and pull request.\n\nNote how it sets up both Go and Node.js environments, reflecting the full-stack nature of the project. The workflow runs 'make build-js' and uses golangci-lint, which correspond to the test and check commands we saw in the Makefile earlier.\n\nThis automated process ensures that all tests pass and code quality checks are performed consistently, catching issues early in the development cycle.","file":".github/workflows/build.yml","highlight":[{"start":1,"end":20}],"title":"","id":"662"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"We've explored Gotify's comprehensive testing and quality assurance practices. As a senior Go engineer, you're well-positioned to contribute. Here are specific ways to enhance the project's reliability:\n\n1. Improve backend test coverage:\n   - Add more unit tests for complex logic in the message API (api/message.go)\n   - Implement integration tests for database interactions\n\n2. Enhance CI/CD pipeline:\n   - Introduce parallel test execution in .github/workflows/build.yml to speed up CI\n   - Add a step to automatically update API documentation when tests pass\n\n3. Cross-functional improvements:\n   - Develop end-to-end tests that validate API responses with frontend interactions\n   - Implement performance benchmarks for critical API endpoints\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you'll significantly contribute to Gotify's long-term reliability and maintainability. Your expertise in Go and interest in frontend interactions will be valuable in creating a robust testing ecosystem.","title":"","id":"663"}]}
