If a valid token is found, it updates the 'last used' timestamp (if necessary).\n4. It then allows the request to proceed to the actual API handler.\n\nThis method is part of a broader authentication strategy in Gotify.

Pagination: The 'limit' parameter allows the frontend to request a specific number of messages.\n2. Sorting: Messages are ordered by ID in descending order, typically showing the newest messages first.\n3. Filtering: The 'since' parameter enables the frontend to implement infinite scrolling or load more features.\n4. Joins: It joins the applications table to ensure the user only sees their own messages.\n\nThis method, along with others like GetApplicationsByUser or GetClientsByUser, forms the backbone of data retrieval for the frontend. When designing new endpoints, consider how the frontend will consume and display the data, and structure your queries accordingly.",
