Interestingly, Gotify opts to unregister service workers at startup, which is an unconventional approach.\n\nThis decision likely stems from prioritizing up-to-date content delivery over offline functionality. By unregistering service workers, Gotify ensures that users always interact with the latest version of the application, avoiding potential issues with cached resources.\n\nThis approach has implications for the application's behavior:\n1. It prioritizes real-time updates over offline capabilities.\n2. It may impact the app's performance on slow networks.\n3. It simplifies the development process by reducing cache-related complexities.\n\nAs you review the code, consider how this design choice aligns with Gotify's goals as a real-time notification service.",
